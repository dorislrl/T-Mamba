# Online Signature Verication Using Augmented Path Signature and T-Mamba
This repository contains the official implementation for online signature verification using  Augmented Path Signatures for robust feature extraction and T-Mamba for efficient sequence modeling.
## Key Features
*Augmented Path Signatures* : Capture fine-grained geometric and analytical properties of signature.

T-Mamba Architecture: To optimize sequence modeling, we introduce T-Mamba, which replaces traditional RNNs/Transformers with a hybrid architecture for superior long-range dependency modeling with linear-time complexity $O(L)$.

High Performance: Optimized for both stylus-based and finger-based online signature datasets including MCYT-100, SVC-2004 Task2, DeepSign DB this three datasets.

## Installation & Environment
The environment setup consists of two main parts: the feature extraction library and the Mamba sequence modeling framework.

1. Requirements
Python 3.10+

PyTorch 2.1.0+

CUDA 11.8+ (Required for Mamba kernels)

2. APS Dependency
For Augmented Path Signatures, we utilize the iisignature library to compute iterated integrals:

```Bash
pip install iisignature
```
3. T-Mamba Environment (SSM)
The core of T-Mamba relies on the selective state space model implementation. We strictly follow the official installation guidelines from [https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba].

To install the necessary kernels, run:
```Bash
pip install causal-conv1d>=1.4.0
pip install mamba-ssm
```
